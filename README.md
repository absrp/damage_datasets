# damage_datasets
Datasets produced in Rodriguez Padilla, A.M., Oskin, M.E., Milliner, C.,and Plesch, A. Widespread rock damage from the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes. Under review in Nature Geoscience.

Includes: 
1. Strain profiles and profile location files.
2. File containing the 3D distance between every aftershock in the QTM catalog and the nearest fault plane. 
3. File containing the 2D distance between every fracture in the lidar, Ponti, and high-resolution imagery maps and the nearest fault.
4. Text files containing the rupture length for the aftershocks, Ponti data, and lidar data (Lfaults_main.txt) and high-resolution imagery data (Lfaults_imagery.txt). These are required for the normalization of density in the damage decay plots. 
5. Shapefiles delimiting the extent of sediment and bedrock at the surface.
